# Auto-Animation Project


Welcome to the Auto-Animation project! This innovative project, inspired by Carykh's [captivating videos](bit.ly/3N0Lndv), allows you to transform your dreams into animated reality. By leveraging the power of Qt and C++ programming, we've developed a tool that automates the animation process based on audio and scripts.
